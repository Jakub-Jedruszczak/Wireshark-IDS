# Wireshark IDS

This is the synoptic project for my Cyber Security degree. This Wireshark plugin implements a signature-based threat detection system using open-source signature databases.

## How to use

Place the extracted folder in `C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\version number` and launch Wireshark. If a new window containing this README shows up, then it is working successfully.
If this does not work, you can change the folder that the plugin will get data from using `Tools > Change Path to Plugin Folder`.
